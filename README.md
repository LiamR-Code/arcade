# Welcome to the arcade!

This repository is an arcade of several extremely tiny and simple python games.

## Setup

The only prerequisite currently is the ability to run python3.

After cloning the repository, simply run `arcade.py` to enter the arcade.  The arcade acts as a menu which can
help you navigate to any game in the repository.

Alternatively, you can also run individual games directly.
